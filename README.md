Cardiovascular-Risk-Classification

This heart disease dataset is acquired from one of the multispecialty hospitals in India.
Over 14 common features make it one of the heart disease datasets available so far for research purposes.
This dataset consists of 1000 subjects with 12 features. This dataset will be useful for building early-stage heart disease detection
as well as for generating predictive machine-learning models.
Applied logistic regression classification models on health survey data to assess heart 
disease risk.
Improved model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
